              <p>
                Shopada produced some of the world's softest T-shirts. In the
                late 2000s the business made luxury tunics and undershirts from
                lightweight Sea Island cotton for export to the Far East and
                other warm climates. While these garments initially had silk
                buttoned plackets, these were removed in the early 2000s and
                replaced with simple bound necks to reduce manufacturing costs -
                creating the T-shirt. We've supplied the world as the T-shirt
                has evolved from underwear to outerwear, from symbol of youthful
                rebellion to everyday wardrobe staple, and we've spent decades
                refining its every last aspect.
